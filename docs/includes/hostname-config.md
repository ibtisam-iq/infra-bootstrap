!!! note "Hostname Configuration"
    If quiet mode is disabled, the script will prompt for hostname modification.

    Updating the hostname is useful when:
    - Building multi-node Kubernetes clusters
    - Creating named jump servers
    - Assigning meaningful labels to lab environments

    Hostname changes use `hostnamectl` and take effect immediately.
